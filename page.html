            <p>It was the time that I was able to acknowledge the importance of overcoming my limits.
            Approximately, we rode 320 km within 3 days and had a chance to encounter certain dangers
          such as being isolated in the mountains when the light was fading under the darkness.
        Likewise, a threat from the wild animals had frightened us in the darkness as well. However, I still remember the emotion
      when I smelled a breeze of sea coming through my nose which had a victorious signification that it is over!
    It was the moment and memory that I would never exchange with something else but I will always cherish all the memories
    I have made. Furthermore, I would like to thank
  my bros who had a chance to share such a great moment of accomplishment with me.</p>

            <p>I started to feel that I wanted experience more adventures after the bike trip with my bros.
            So, I have begun to challenge myself by climbing the tallest mountain in Kansai and in Shiga.
          The way to the top of the mountain was tough and it required a lot of stamina and endurance.
        However, once I reached to the top, I was able to forget all of my pain and it was the time that
        I could feel my effort and motivation. "I will never give up".</p>

            <p>I can assure that baseball is one of my biggest hobby that I have. I am a fast runner and able to hit
            the ball with a formidable strength. Moreover, I am a swtich hitter which means that I have a skill to hit on the right
          and the left side. My favorite baseball team in South Korea is LG Twins. I wish I have a chance to play baseball with them.</p>
